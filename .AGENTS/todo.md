# TODO / Plan

## Active Run: Orchestrator + Backlog Normalization

- [x] Audit current planning docs and tracker freshness post-push.
- [x] Declare SSOT tracker model (`TODO_JetBrains.md` authoritative, `todo-final.md` mirror).
- [x] Reconcile parity completion-check contradictions.
- [x] Align docs index references to SSOT.
- [ ] Select and execute next non-blocking implementation batch (M3/M4).

## Review

- Status: M1 normalization complete; ready for next implementation batch.
- Notes:
  - Tracker drift corrected in docs/planning files.
  - Next step is code/test work under M3/M4 scope.
