Act as a senior IntelliJ plugin engineer; using codex-jetbrains-starter, execute TODO_JetBrains.md from top to bottom, integrate with the Codex CLI via `codex proto` JSON lines, build a robust ToolWindow chat with approvals, diff/exec flows, model/effort controls, MCP listing, tests and post-tests per subtask, commit per subtask with the required format, and deliver near-parity with the official Codex VS Code extension.
