# Release Cadence Plan

## Channels
- Alpha: internal validation builds for major protocol/UI changes
- Beta: candidate builds for broader tester feedback
- Stable: signed/public marketplace releases

## Cadence
- Patch releases (`0.1.x`): on-demand for bug fixes/high-priority regressions
- Minor releases (`0.x+1.0`): every 4-6 weeks when feature batches are complete

## Entry Criteria (Stable)
- Full CI/test/verifyPlugin green
- Manual smoke validation in supported IDE targets
- Updated changelog and release notes
- No unresolved P0/P1 issues

## Exit Criteria (Post-Release)
- Publish retrospective within 7 days
- Triage incoming issues and assign severity labels
- Update roadmap and release tracker
